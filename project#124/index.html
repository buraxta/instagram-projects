<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>
<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that
wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: borders, padding, 
margins, and the actual content.</p>
<div>This text is the content of the box. 
We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin 
and a 15px green border.</div>
